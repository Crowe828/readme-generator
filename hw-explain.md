Because this is a command-line application that won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of your application. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You should include a link to the video in your application's `README.md` file.

Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
